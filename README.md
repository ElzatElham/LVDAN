# DA-YOLOV8
This is the official PyTorch implementation of our paper: 

**DA-YOLOv8**


# Installation

Clone repo and install [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ElzatElham/DA-YOLOV8/blob/main/requirements.txt) in a Python>=3.7 environment, including PyTorch>=1.13.1.


```
# Create a virtual environment
conda create -n da-yolo python=3.7

# Enter the DA-YOLO directory
cd DA-YOLOV8-main

# install requirement
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install ultralytics
python setup.py install


```

The main modification is the loss function, located in ultralytics/yolo/utils/loss.py

**Noteï¼š** You can directly modify the relevant code in ultralytics to implement other functionalities, such as adding attention mechanisms or changing the backbone. However, after making the modifications, you need to run `python setup.py install` again to apply the code changes.

# t-SNE Visualization
The visualization code is located at: DA-YOLOV8/t-sne/plt_t-sne.py 

```
python DA-YOLOV8/t-sne/plt_t-sne.py --Input_path image_dir --size 2 512
```

--Input_path: All images are directly placed in this directory. Previous results used all images from those 4 datasets. 

--size: The size to resize the images. Since all images are square and have a size of 512, if size=512, it means visualizing the original images. If size=2, a large amount of data has been resized, but the results are better. If you want to plot multiple images with different resizes simultaneously, fill in multiple target size numbers separated by spaces.
